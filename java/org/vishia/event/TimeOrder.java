/**This is the base class for time orders.
 * To define a time order a derived class of this should be written which overrides the method 
 * {@link #executeOrder()}. An instance of this class can be created statically as persistent reference
 * or on demand with new {@link TimeOrder#TimeOrder(String, EventTimerThread)}. The {@link EventTimerThread} should 
 * be existing as instance before an instance of this class is created.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Pattern for application</b>:<br><pre>
 * EventThread thread = new EventThread("name");
 * ...
 * //a time order as inner anonymous class:
 * EventTimeOrder order = new EventTimeOrder("name", thread) {
 *   QOverride protected void executeOrder(){
 *     ...code for time order
 *   }
 * }
 * ...
 * thread.start();
 * order.activate(100); //the order will be executed in the thread in 100 ms.
 * </pre>
 * <b>An EventTimeOrder can be enqueued in the EventThread but executed in another thread.</b> 
 * It uses an {@link EventConsumer}, see {@link org.vishia.event.test.TestTimeOrder}, with the following pattern</b>:
 * <pre>
 *  
 * private static class EnqueueInGraphicThread implements EventConsumer {
 *   (at)Override public int processEvent(EventObject ev)
 *   { execThread.queueOrders.put((< EventTimeOrder >)ev);  //casting admissible because special using.
 *     return mEventConsumed;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This class is designated as EventObject because it can be used as event immediately after 
 * or independent whether it is handled by the timer.
 * <br><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Constructors: {@link TimeOrder#TimeOrder(String, EventTimerThread)},
 *   {@link TimeOrder#TimeOrder(String, EventConsumer, EventTimerThread)}, {@link TimeOrder#TimeOrder(String)} .
 * <li>methods to activate from {@link EventTimeout}: {@link #activate(int)}, {@link #activateAt(long)}, {@link #activateAt(long, long)}
 * <li>Remove a currently timeout: {@link #deactivate()}
 * <li>Check from {@link EventTimeout}: {@link #timeExecution()}, {@link #timeExecutionLatest()}, {@link #timeToExecution()} {@link #used()}
 * <li>Check: {@link #getCtDone(int)}
 * <li>Execute: {@link #doExecute()} will be called from the {@link EventTimerThread}, only call by application in a special thread. 
 * <li>Wait for execution in another thread: {@link #awaitExecution(int, int)}.
 * <li>see {@link EventTimeout}.
 * <li>see {@link EventTimerThread}
 * <li>see {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine}
 * </ul>

  /**Version and history.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2015-05-03 Hartmut on {@link #awaitExecution(int, int)} wait if the thread is busy. It should be done
   *   especially if the order is in debug. Not ready checked yet whether it is well running.
   * <li>2015-01-10 Hartmut renamed from <code>OrderForList</code>
   * <li>2014-02-23 Hartmut removed from the component srcJava_vishiaGui to the srcJava_vishiaBase 
   *   because it is commonly able to use.
   * <li>2012-02-14 Hartmut corr: {@link #addToList(GralGraphicThread, int)}:
   *   For time saving: If an instance is added already and its new execution time
   *   is up to 5 ms later, nothing is done. It saves time for more as one call of this routine
   *   in a fast loop.
   * <li>2012-02-14 Hartmut corr: It was happen that an instance was designated with {@link #bAdded}==true
   *   but it wasn't added, Therefore on {@link #addToList(GralGraphicThread, int)} it is removed
   *   from list and added newly. It is more save. 
   * <li>2012-01-26 Hartmut chg: rename removeFromGraphicThread(GralGraphicThread) 
   *   to {@link #removeFromList(GralGraphicThread)}. It is a better naming because it is removed from the queue
   *   in the graphic thread. This class is only used in that queue. 
   * <li>2012-01-15 Hartmut new: {@link #name} to identify, proper for debugging
   * <li>2012-01-08 Hartmut new: {@link #addToList(GralGraphicThread, int)} and 
   *   {@link #removeFromList(GralGraphicThread)} as thread-safe functions which 
   *   marks the instance as added (for delayed execution, for re-using).
   * <li>2010-06-00 Hartmut created.
