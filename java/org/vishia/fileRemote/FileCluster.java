/**This class ensures that the same {@link FileRemote} instances is used for the same string given path.
 * Different parts of the application can set some attributes in FileRemote, especially masks,
 * it is ensured that all usages get the same instance for the same path.   
 * It means also that the properties of a file of the operation system should be read only one time for one Java application.
 * The access to the os file system is reduced. That is usefull especially for a remote file system.
 * But of course synchronizations due to changes of the file system's content is a topic.
 * The operation system's file properties should be synchronized with the FileRemote properties if necessary.
 * <br>
 * One difference between FileRemote and the operation system's file handling is: 
 * FileRemote knows more properties for a file especially mark bits. They should be stored also unique as properties of the file.
 * That is the first reason for this solution.

  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2023-07-15 Hartmut chg: Some errors were obviously caused on non uppercase in windows and non found path from the first level
   *   if the FileRemote was also created, but only as child from the root level. fixed.
   * <li>2023-04-02 Hartmut chg: Now uses the TreeMap instead of IndexMultiTable, it's better for debugging. 
   *   But the functionality have a Iterator for a dedicated range (key start with given string) is not supported by TreeMap.
   *   To fulfill it, now the {@link ListSubdirs} iterator was built for unchanged {@link #listSubdirs(String)}.
   *   But {@link #listSubdirs(String)} is a little bit changed: It does not need to return a ListIterator, 
   *   a simple {@link Iterator} is sufficient. This simplifies the {@link ListSubdirs}.
   * <li>2023-04-02 Hartmut improved: {@link #idxPaths} contains paths in upper case for windows. There was sometimes irritations,
   *   if a directory was given as String in faulty case, was found as file, and was contained twice here.
   *   {@link #getFile(CharSequence, CharSequence, boolean)} and {@link #searchOrCreateDir(String)} 
   *   builds upper case for search key. 
   * <li>2023-04-02 Hartmut adapted: Because of {@link FileRemote#getPathChars()} now returns a '/' on end,
   *   but the paths in {@link #idxPaths} are stored without slash, some adaptions were necessary.
   * <li>2023-04-02 Hartmut cleanup XXXgetFile(...), and XXXcheck(...), that are unused since 2014-12-30  
   * <li>2023-02-03 Hartmut chg: not processed but asserted that the given directory for all calls is normalized. 
   *   This saves unnecessary calculation time, because usual the path is normalized and absolute, because it comes from the cluster itself
   *   or proper from the file system. 
   * <li>2017-09-15 Hartmut chg: on {@link #getFile(CharSequence, CharSequence, boolean)}: If the file was not found in the index,
   *   the new private {@link #searchOrCreateDir(String)} is invoked instead immediately creating a new FileRemote instance. 
   *   That routine checks whether the parent is registered and whether the path describes a known FileRemote instance as child of parent.
   *   Then that instance is used and registered. Because that routine is invoked recursively, the root will be found. 
   *   Either that is known, or the root is registered yet, especially on start. For that, all existing FileRemote instances should be re-found, 
   *   and never a new instance is created though one is exists.  
   * <li>2017-08-27 Hartmut chg: On {@link #getFile(CharSequence, CharSequence, boolean)} only {@link FileSystem#normalizePath(CharSequence)}
   *   is invoked. Not {@link FileSystem#getCanonicalPath(File)}: Reason: On this access the operation system's file system must not accessed.
   *   Only an existing {@link FileRemote} instance is searched and returned. Especially if a network directory is accessed and the
   *   network is not accessible, this invocation must not hang! It is used in the graphic thread in the org.vishia.commander.  
   * <li>2014-12-30 Hartmut chg: Now all parent directories till the root are stored in the table. Therefore the searching algorithm 
   *   is simplified. Backward search is unnecessary because the parent path is found or it is not stored. Now all as possible directory
   *   instances are stored, the tables are greater. The searching is more simple.
   * <li>2014-12-20 Hartmut bugfix: Some files were created more as one with the same path. It were files with lesser pathname 
   *   which are not found in the {@link #idxPaths}: fix: Check backward, therefore the {@link IndexMultiTable#iterator(Comparable)}
   *   is a {@link ListIterator} up to now. 
   * <li>2013-06-15 Hartmut bugfix: create a FileRemote as directory. It is the convention, that the 
   *   property whether or not a FileRemote is a directory does not depend on a {@link FileRemote#isTested()}.
   * <li>2013-05-05 Hartmut chg: get(...) now renamed to getFile(...). {@link #getFile(CharSequence, CharSequence, boolean)}
   *   checks whether a parent instance or deeper child instance is registered already and use that.
   * <li>2013-05-05 Hartmut new: {@link #check(CharSequence, CharSequence)}  
   * <li>2013-04-22 Hartmut created. The base idea was: Select files and use this selection in another part of application.
   *   It should be ensured that the same instance is used for the selection and other usage.
