/**This class extends the StringPartScan to determine the content with reading the String from a file,
 * from a file resource in jar file or from any other opened resource as {@link Reader}.
 * <br>
 * The resource itself can have a unlimited length. The length of the buffer is determined
 * in the constructor. The next content is read using {@link #readNextContent(int)}.
 * This routine checks whether there is enough space to read a next content.
 * The essential values for that are the {@link StringPart#begin} value. 
 * It is assumed that the content before {@link StringPart#begin} are already processed
 * and hence no more necessary. 
 * Additional the {@link #readNextContent(int)} expects an at least number of chars to read.
 * If the {@link StringPart#begin} is lesser as that argument, nothing is read.
 * With that rule the {@link #readNextContent(int)} can be called any time without check, 
 * but does nothing of it is not necessary, to save time. 
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Calculation of the buffer size and the minPosToRead:</b><br>
 * It should be regarded that a currently scan process uses a spread in the text. 
 * Sometimes the parsing runs in iterations and is reseted to a more left start point.
 * It depends from the algorithm of evaluating the content. 
 * The ideal case is, that the whole file can take place in the buffer. 
 * But then with decision of the buffer size the file size to evaluate is also determined. 
 * <br><br>
 * The necessary spread for parsing determines the size. 
 * If a file can be parsed line per line then the buffer size (constructor argument)
 * should be greater than twice times the longest expected line
 * or for non-lined orientated files the longest expected element. 
 * For example on XML files the longest exepected element is the longest value
 * for a text of an element of an attribute value.

  /**Version, history and license.
   * list of changes:
   * <ul>2022-03-28 Hartmut bugfix: Now returns the first line as 1. Before, the first line was 0.
   *    Yet this is used for test, not only manual view, thats why finally fixed.
   * <li>2020-02-10 Hartmut new {@link #StringPartFromFileLines(Reader, String, int)}
   *   <br>{@link #StringPartFromFileLines(InputStream, String, int, String, Charset)} with negativ argument sizeBuffer
   * <li>2020-02-02 Hartmut new {@link #StringPartFromFileLines(Class, String, int, String, Charset)}
   *   <br>{@link #StringPartFromFileLines(InputStream, String, int, String, Charset)} with negativ argument sizeBuffer
   * <li>2018-12-22 Hartmut bugfix in {@link StringPart}, improvement here: {@link #readnextContentFromFile(int)} shifts only {@link StringPart#begin}/2 
   *   to save the content near to and left from the current working area for access capability of a {@link Part} near the current content.  
   * <li>2018-01-06 Hartmut bugfix, bug: If the file to read was only 201..209 Bytes, the bytes after 200 were not read. 
   *   fix: readnextContentFromFile(0) instead (10) necessary, to read in any case. 2017-12: Renaming package private maxIxLinePosition vs. endIxLinePosition. 
   * <li>2016-09-25 Hartmut now works with lesser buffer.
   * <li>2015-10-24 Hartmut new: {@link StringPartFromFileLines#StringPartFromFileLines(InputStream, String, int, String, Charset)}
   *   to use with <code>ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("path");   
   * <li>2015-06-07 Hartmut chg: {@link #getLineAndColumn(int[])}: column counts from 1 on leftest position.
   * <li>2014-05-22 Hartmut new: {@link #setInputfile(String)} invoked with input file 
   * <li>2014-04-22 Hartmut chg: improved line numbers 
   * <li>2012-12-22 Hartmut chg: close() the file in constructor if the whole file was read.
   * <li>2010-02-11 Hartmut new: The ctor StringPartFromFileLines(File fromFile) is added, 
   *   it is compatible to StringPartFromFile now.
   * <li>2009-05-31 Hartmut detecting and ignoring a BOM (byte order mark) as first char.
   * <li>2009-04-09 Hartmut encoding detection korrig.
   * <li>2006-05-00 Hartmut creation
