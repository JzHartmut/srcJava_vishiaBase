If you have gotten the testJava_vishiaBase as zip from github
then you should get on this location also the 

srcJava_vishiaBase-master.zip

usual also in the last version. On this location the folder

srcJava_vishiaBase

should be unpacked with its content. 

Another possibility is using the vishiaBase-20yy-mm-dd-source.zip from the deploy archive
beside the zip (https://vishia.org/Java/deploy)

You can also clone the git repository here to access all versions.
