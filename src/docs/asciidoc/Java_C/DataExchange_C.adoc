== Java and C/++ - two different worlds?

Java has its own rationale
Java programs are proper in source code (software technological)
and run optimal after byte code translation on several platforms. 

C and {cpp} are a settled world, also rational. 
Both worlds seems to be not related, except both can run on the same processors.
A bridge between Java and {Cp} is the Java Native Interface link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface[]
or also the Java Native Access link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Access[].
Both concepts enables combination between Java and {Cp} programming 
on the same processor / in the same process. 

But often Java and {Cp} can be well separated. 
This has some advantages, on the one hand an independence between both platforms,
on the other hand an independence in terms of dependencies and developers.
If it is separated, both runs in independent processes (on an Operation System, on PC)
or maybe in different compilation units or software blocks.

The question is: Data exchange. With the focus on data exchange it is very more simple:

* Java has its own infrastructure, reads data from {Cp} parts and produces data for {Cp}.
* {Cp} has also its own infrastructure, with data exchange to Java parts.

But how data exchange is organized?

There are some very simple approaches:

* Data exchange via Socket telegrams or adequate channels
* Data exchange in a common RAM
* Data exchange as content of files. 

== Same data structures for C/++ and Java

In C usual data structures can be defined via a `struct`. 
To make it compatible some rules should be regarded.
But that rules should be known and are the same topics as data exchange 
between different {Cp} parts. 
See for example link:../../../emc/html/Base/int_pack_endian.html[].
In other world: A proper data image is clarified for {Cp}.

In Java a compatible data image can be offered using the `byte[]` type. 
The only one problem is: How to read and write data from a `byte[]` field 
without primitive (low level) access and conversion. 

An answer is the class link:../../docuSrcJava_vishiaBase/org/vishia/byteData/ByteDataAccessBase.html[org.vishia.byteData/ByteDataAccessBase.java]. 

Another answer may be usage of the features of `java.nio.ByteBuffer`

== org.vishia.bytedata.ByteDataAccessBase - a short history

This class was one of the first Java programs which I have written on exploration good features
in Java, coming from width knowledge of {Cp} programming, in the first years of the 2000^th^,
written with knowledge of deal with data (from {Cp} experience). 
Studying the Java functions later I found that there is another approach
to access float etc. in a `byte[]` buffer, for example the `java.nio.ByteBuffer#getFloat()`.
It seems to be more better and especially a standard. 
But a calculation time comparison has shown, that my own functions, which are written
at low level byte access with conversion routines, were not slower, 
partially there were faster than the `java.nio...` routines.
Why is it so? The Java Bytecode Compiler (JIT) generates access code to the bytes
which is so fast as C access. 
Simple shift and or operations are optimized as also in C compiling.
The standard routines in `java.nio` should regard some system settings too, 
in the end they are not faster. 
Because the `org.vishia.bytedata.ByteDataAccessBase` have some interesting special features,
I have improved this class by using and used furthermore.

The principle is: `org.vishia.bytedata.ByteDataAccessBase` is a base class
which contains access and build of primitive Java data on any position in the buffer.
Which position is used, it is determined by the implementing class, 
which should be present user data structures. 
The positions can be constant, mapping a struct definition from C language.
But they can be also dynamic. 
Especially for evaluating payloads of communication telegrams starting from the beginning
there was a tree structure: The data mapping can depend from given data before. 
The idea in the beginning was: Data can be also present in an XML tree. 
Thats why older docs talk about '_XmlBinCoding_'. 
But 'presentation in XML' is an independent thing. 
It is possible, of course, but not necessary to do so.



== Mapping of a given data struct in a derived class

The derived class should only contain final routines for access, for example:

----
public final int nrofBytes() { return getInt16(k_nrofBytes); }
----

whereas `k_nrofBytes` is a const definition in an extra part to have overview. 
The called `getInt16(...)` routine is also `protected final`, 
hence the JIT compiler can optimize the machine code.

A derived class for a given data C-`struct` or fix mapping can/should be generated, 
not written manually. It reduce effort if many similar structs are necessary.

== Tree of different data parts

This is offered in link:../../../Jc/html/ByteDataAccess.html[]. 

The documentation in link:../../docuSrcJava_vishiaBase/org/vishia/byteData/ByteDataAccessBase.html[org.vishia.byteData/ByteDataAccessBase.java]
should explain the usage. Last but not least there are some test examples in
